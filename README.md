# Dissertation-HTML
This repository holds the HTML files used for my Dissertation Project from the University of Greenwich 2025. These files help build a very simple website to simulate a real world target for DNS attacks.

This website here is not meant nor ever intended to simulate a real website. The information held within this website is entirely fabricated for the purpose of useless information and any links/references to any real world pre-existing sensitive information is entirely coincidental.
